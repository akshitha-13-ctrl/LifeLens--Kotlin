1. Problem Statement 

In today’s fast-paced environment, students often deal with stress, mood swings, overthinking, and emotional imbalance. 
There are many wellness apps available, but most of them feel too formal and do not engage the user emotionally. 
We wanted to create a space where emotional healing feels fun, calming, and interactive — not like “therapy,” but like a soothing game. 

Shape 

2. Idea Description 

Planet Reborn is an emotional-healing adventure game set in a fictional universe called Nauvara. 
Each planet inside the universe represents a different emotion, and players complete calming activities to restore balance in that planet. 

As the player heals planets, the entire universe slowly comes back to life. 
Once Nauvara is fully healed, a new universe unlocks, giving the player a sense of progress and achievement.

4. Emotional Worlds (Planets) 

Each planet represents one core emotion: 

Joy – Planet Solara 
Bright, warm, glowing with light energy. 

Sadness – Planet Lunora 
Calm, cool, moon-like environment with gentle blues. 

Fear – Planet Ecliptis 
Slightly dark atmosphere, eclipse-based visuals. 

Anger – Planet Pyronox 
Strong fiery tones, lava designs, intense energy. 

The player heals these planets by completing emotional activities. 
Difficulty increases very slowly so players feel relaxed, not stressed.
